# Leap birthday

People that are born on February 29 are called leap-year babies. Leap-year babies only have an actual birthday on leap years. Born on any other date it easy to compute when you can celebrate your $$k$$'th birthday. Not so for leap-year babies.

Implement a program called `birthday.py` that asks the user for a number $$k$$ and compute the *k'th birthday of a leap-year baby born on February 29 2000*.

Example 1:

	Enter a number: 1
	Birthday #1 is in the year 2004

Example 2:

	Enter a number: 2
	Birthday #2 is in the year 2008

Example 3:

	Enter a number: 1000
	Birthday #1000 is in the year 6124

## Specification

* Ask the user to provide a positive number. If the number is not positive ask again.

* Print the $$k$$'th leap year starting from 2000 (so 2000 is the 0th, and 2004 is the 1st year).

## Decomposition
Again, take a couple of minutes of time, before you start coding, to draw the problem with **pen and paper**. Illustrate how you would take on this problem and how you would divide the problem into smaller and simpler steps.

## Hint
Of course you can use the code from the previous exercise. But, you might want to use a `while`-loop in stead of a `for`-loop.

Why is that? In the previous exercise we knew before entering the loop exactly at which year it should end. So, it was easy to define a `range` to loop over. Not so here. Which year do we need to stop? We cannot know this *before* entering the loop.

When does the while loop stop?

## Testing

To be sure to test your program using `checkpy`:

	checkpy birthday
