# Monte Carlo

Write a function that, by way of the Monte Carlo method, calculates the integral of any mathematical function with specified integral boundaries. Take care that both the function as well as the generated random points (both the 'correct' and 'incorrect' ones) are displayed on the screen.

## Specification

* Create a new file called `montecarlo.py`.

* Declare a function called `montecarlo()` that can calculate integrals by using a Monte Carlo simulation.

* The function `montecarlo()` should accept five arguments:

	- `func` a function of which the integral will be calculated
	- `x1` the minimum x-value surrounding the integral area
	- `y1` the minimum y-value surrounding the integral area
	- `x2` the maximum x-value surrounding the integral area
	- `y2` the maximum y-value surrounding the integral area

* The function `montecarlo()` should `return` the area under the graph.

* The function `montecarlo()` should plot the function and the points *within* the integral area (the 'correct' points) in green and the point *outside of* the integral area (the 'incorrect' points) in red.

## Functions as arguments

The Monte Carlo method is another way to approximate an integral, different
from the Riemann sum method covered earlier. Another difference here is that
this approximation method should now be able to integrate **any** function and
not just quadratic functions. This is done by making the function that is being
integrated an argument of integration function.

## Testing

Test your procedure using the following function, which should be easy verify:

	def func1(x):
		return 2*x

Also test your program with the following functions. Some can even only can
only be numerically approximated, and have no analytical solution.

$$\int_{0}^{1}x^2 dx$$

$$\int_{0}^{1}x^{x+\frac{1}{2}} ~dx$$

$$\int_{0}^{\pi}sin(x) dx$$

$$\int_{0.2}^{2.2} \tan(\cos(\sin(x))) ~dx$$

$$\int_{0}^{\pi} \sin(x^2) ~dx$$

Add these functions to you own program and make sure to call `montecarlo()` a number of times at the bottom of the file, to verify each of these examples.

## Hints

* Create a graph of the function so you have a clear view of what area you are integrating.

* Also create a graph with red and green points like in the example in the theory section. Should you have made a mistake in your logic, you can immediately see it in the graph, instead of having to spend hours looking at your code to find the bug.

* Think carefully how to deal with parts of the integral area that are situated below the x-axis.

	* When encountered with 'negative integral areas' you can split the areas.

* The size of the rectangle around the integral area should be chosen as tight as possible to maximize efficiency.

* First test your program for an integral of which you know the outcome beforehand. For a few of the example functions that should be the case. Once the program correctly calculates the known integrals, you can try the unknown new integrals.
